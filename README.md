**NB**:  This library is undergoing a face lift.  To see the old functionality that this new code is leading up to, go [here](README_OLD.md)

*trans-render* (TR) provides a methodical way of instantiating a template.  It draws inspiration from the (least) popular features of XSLT.  Like XSLT, TR performs transforms on elements by matching tests on elements.  Whereas XSLT uses XPath for its tests, TR uses css path tests via the element.matches() and element.querySelectorAll() methods.  Unlike XSLT, though, the transform is defined with JavaScript, adhering to JSON-like declarative constraints as much as possible.

It's designed to provide an alternative to the proposed [Template Instantiation proposal](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Template-Instantiation.md), with the idea being that it could continue to supplement what that proposal provides if/when it lands in browsers.

XSLT can take pure XML with no formatting instructions as its input.  Generally speaking, the XML that XSLT acts on isn't a bunch of semantically  meaningless div tags, but rather a nice semantic document, whose intrinsic structure is enough to go on, in order to formulate a "transform" that doesn't feel like a hack.

There is a growing (ðŸŽ‰) list of semantically meaningful native-born DOM Elements which developers can and should utilize, including dialog, datalist, details/summary, popup (ðŸ¤ž) etc. which can certainly help reduce divitis.

But even more dramatically, with the advent of imported, naturalized custom elements, the ratio between semantically meaningful tag names and divs/spans in the template markup will tend to grow far more, looking much more like XML of yore. trans-render's usefulness grows as a result of the increasingly semantic nature of the template markup, because often the markup semantics provide enough clues on how to fill in the needed "potholes," like textContent and property setting, without the need for custom markup, like binding attributes.  But trans-render is completely extensible, so it can certainly accommodate custom binding attributes by using additional, optional helper libraries.

This can leave the template markup quite pristine, but it does mean that the separation between the template and the binding instructions will tend to require looking in two places, rather than one.  And if the template document structure changes, separate adjustments may be needed to keep the binding rules in sync.  Much like how separate style rules often need adjusting when the document structure changes.

<!--Not designed for binding a single element -- that can be handled by xtal-element's PEA support.

Doesn't need to support what can be supported by custom elements -- loops, conditionals

Use cases:

Interpolation
tag replacement 

supportsGeneralQuery by ending:  part, class, data, element

## The core library

The core library, transform.js, is a tiny (1.2k gzip/minified), 'non-committal' library that simply allows us to map css matches to user-defined functions. 

Its first value-add proposition is it can reduce the amount of imperative *.selectQueryAll().forEach's needed in our code.  However, by itself, transform.js is not a complete solution, if you are looking for declarative syntax.  That will come with the ability to extend transform.js, which will be discussed below.

The CSS matching transform.js takes one of two forms:

1.  multi-matching for all (custom) DOM elements within the scope.
2.  Scoping matches.

### Multi-matching

Consider the following example (please expand).  Don't worry, it looks quite complicated, but we will walk through it, and also, as we introduce more features, the code below will greatly simplify:

    </template>
    <div id=container></div>
    <script type="module">
        import { transform } from '../../lib/transform.js';
        transform(Main, {
            match: {
                countData: ({target, val}) =>{
                    target.addEventListener('click', e => {
                        const newCount = parseInt(e.target.dataset.count) + 1;
                        e.target.dataset.count = newCount;
                        transform(container, {
                            match: {
                                countWideClass: ({target}) => {
                                    target.textContent = newCount;
                                },
                                vitaminDElement: ({target}) => {
                                    target.textContent = 2 * newCount;
                                },
                                tripleDeckerPart: ({target}) => {
                                    target.textContent = 3 * newCount;
                                },
                                jan8Id: ({target}) => {
                                    target.textContent = 4 * newCount;
                                },
                                textContentProp: 5 * newCount,
                            }
                        });
                    })

                }
            }
        }, container);
    </script>
</body>
```

</details>

The first thing to note is that id's become global constants outside of ShadowDOM.  Hence we can refer to "Main" and "container" directly in the JavaScript:

```JavaScript
transform(Main, { 
    ...
}
```


The keyword "match" indicates that within that block are CSS Matches.  In this example, all the matches are "multi-matches" because they end with either "Class", "Element", "Part", "Id", "Prop" or "Data".

So for example, this:

```JavaScript
countData: ({target, val}) => {
    ...
}
```

is short-hand for:

```JavaScript
fragment.querySelectorAll('dataset-count').forEach(target => {
    const val = target.dataset.count;
    ...
})
```

What we also see in this example, is that the transform function can be used for two scenarios:

1.  Instantiating a template into a target container in the live DOM tree:

```JavaScript
transform(Main, {...}, container)
```

2.  Updating an existing DOM tree:

```JavaScript
transform(container, {...})
```

## An example of an imperative helper function

[Demo](https://jsfiddle.net/bahrus/4897cbzj/2/)

Since trans-render is built around css matching, it doesn't provide much help when it comes to string interpolation, something supported by virtually every templating library.  trans-render can support something like this via a reusable, shared transform helper function.  The library trans-render/lib/interpolate.js is provided for this purpose.

</details>

Is this as convenient as most templating libraries, where you don't have to add some indicator (like data-int) to every tag inside of which interpolating is to occur?  No.  Interpolation is definitely not TR's strongest use case.  This is definitely a feature I'd like to see with native template instantiation.

## Extending trans-render with declarative syntax

The examples so far have relied heavily on arrow functions.  As we've seen, it provides support for 100% no-holds-barred non-declarative code:

```TypeScript
const matches = { //TODO check that this works
    details:{
        summary: ({target}: RenderContext<HTMLSummaryElement>) => {
            ///knock yourself out
            target.appendChild(document.body);
        }
    }
}
```

These arrow functions can return a value.  trans-render's "postMatch" processors allows us to enhance what any custom function does, via some reusable (user-defined) processors.  If one of these reusable processors is sufficient for the task at hand, then the arrow function can be replaced by a JSON-like expression, allowing the reusable processor to do its thing, after being passed the context.  trans-render provides a few "standard" processors, which address common concerns.

The first common concern is setting the textContent of an element.

## Mapping textContent

One of the most common things we want to do is set the text content of a DOM Element, from some model value.

```html
<details id=details>
    <summary>E pluribus unum</summary>
    ...
</details>

<script type="module">
    import { transform } from '../../lib/transform.js';
    import { Texter } from '../../lib/Texter.js'
    const hello = 'hello, world';
    transform(details, {
        match:{
            summary: hello
        },
        postMatch: [{rhsType: String, ctor: Texter}]
    })
</script>
```

Or more simply, you can hard-code the greeting, and start to imagine that the binding could (partly) come from some (imported) JSON:

```html
<details id=details>
    <summary>E pluribus unum</summary>
    ...
</details>

<script type="module">
    import { transform } from '../../lib/transform.js';
    import { Texter } from '../../lib/Texter.js'
    transform(details, {
        match:{
            summary: 'HallÃ¥'
        },
        postMatch: [{rhsType: String, ctor: Texter}]
    })
</script>
```


Sure, there are easier ways to set the summary to 'hello, world', but as the amount of binding grows, the amount of boilerplate will grow more slowly, using this syntax.

Note the configuration setting associated with the transform function, "postMatch".  postMatch is what allows us to reduce the amount of imperative code, replacing it with JSON-like declarative-ish binding instead.  What the postMatch expression is saying is "since the right-hand-side of the expression:

```JavaScript
summary: 'HallÃ¥'
```

is a string, use the Textor class to process the rendering context." 

The brave developer can implement some other way of interpreting a right-hand-side of type "String".  This is the amount of engineering firepower required to implement the Texter processor:

```Typescript
import {PMDo, RenderContext} from './types.js';

export class Texter implements PMDo{
    do(ctx: RenderContext){
        ctx.target!.textContent = ctx.rhs;
    }
}
```

The categories that currently can be declaratively processed in this way are driven by how many primitive types [JavaScript supports](https://github.com/bahrus/trans-render/blob/baseline/lib/matchByType.ts):   

```TypeScript
export function matchByType(val: any, typOfProcessor: any){
    if(typOfProcessor === undefined) return 0;
    switch(typeof val){
        case 'object':
            return val instanceof typOfProcessor ? 1 : -1; 
        case 'string':
            return typOfProcessor === String ? 1 : -1;
        case 'number':
            return typOfProcessor === Number ? 1 : -1;
        case 'boolean':
            return typOfProcessor === Boolean ? 1 : -1;
        case 'symbol':
            return typOfProcessor === Symbol ? 1 : -1;
        case 'bigint':
            return typOfProcessor === BigInt ? 1 : -1;
    }
    return 0;    
}
```

The most interesting case is when the RHS is of type Object.  As you can see, we use the instanceOf to see if the rhs of the expression is an instance of the postMatch rule.  The first match of the postMatch array wins out. 

We'll be walking through the "standard post script processors" that trans-render provides, but always remember that alternatives can be used based on the requirements.  The standard processors are striving to make the binding syntax as JSON-friendly as possible.

## What does wdwsf stand for?

As you may have noticed, some abbreviations are used by this library:

* ctx = (rendering) context
* idx = (numeric) index of array
* ctor = class constructor
* rhs = right-hand side
* lhs = left-hand side

## P[E[A[T]]]

After setting the string value of a node, setting properties, attaching event handlers, as well as attributes comes next in things we do over and over again.

For this functionality, we use tuples to represent these settings.  P stands for Properties, E for events, A for attributes, and T for transform or template.  There are four nested, and subsequently larger processors that can do one or more of these 4 things.  It is a good idea to use the "weakest" processor for what you need, thereby reducing the footprint of your web component.
