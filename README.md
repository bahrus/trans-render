The *trans-rendering* npm package provides useful utilities for instantiating a template, including utilities that could still be useful even if template instantiation gets [built into the browser](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Template-Instantiation.md).

## Template part caching

Perhaps the most important service this npm package provides is to extract inline [custom enhancements](https://github.com/bahrus/be-enhanced) out of a template, and apply them as efficiently as possible for each cloned instance of the template.  It does this using the tiny ["cache"](https://github.com/bahrus/trans-render/blob/baseline/lib/cache.ts) utility.

If the developer utilizes the growing list of custom enhancements effectively, the developer will rarely need to use any other feature this package provides, as far as template instantiation.

This feature is largely used "behind the scenes", so that the developer need not be aware this feature exists.

It is used in conjunction with be-hive's "beatify.js" function.

However, there are scenarios where it isn't practical to insert binding instructions into the HTML we need to instantiate or process.  For that we need:

## Binding from a distance

*trans-rendering* (TR) describes a methodical way of instantiating a template, and updating the DOM that emanated from said template.  It originally drew inspiration from the (least) popular features of XSLT, but has since evolved to more closely resemble standard CSS.  Like XSLT, TR performs transforms on elements by matching tests on those elements.  TR uses css tests on elements via the element.matches() and element.querySelectorAll() methods.  Unlike XSLT, though, the transform is defined with JavaScript, adhering to JSON-like declarative constraints as much as possible.

TR rests on:

1.  A host that inherits from EventTarget and either contains standard getters/setters, or implements a "propagating" protocol.
2.  A template that serves as the originator of the DOM structure (optional).
3.  A template instantiation manifest (TIM), separate from the template itself.  
4.  A target element to fill and/or update.

The key to trans-rendering is the template instantiation manifest, which will be discussed in detail below.

A subset of TR, also described below, is "declarative trans-render" syntax [DTR], which is pure, 100% declarative syntax.  

DTR is designed to provide an alternative to the proposed [Template Instantiation proposal](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Template-Instantiation.md), the idea being that DTR could continue to supplement what that proposal includes if/when template instantiation support lands in browsers.

Other uses cases for TR/DTR:

1.  Hydrating / adjusting server-rendered content.
2.  Hydrating / adjusting (third party) HTML retrieved via fetch.
3.  Hydrating / adjusting (third party) HTML output from an XSLT transform.

XSLT can take pure XML with no formatting instructions as its input.  Generally speaking, the XML that XSLT acts on isn't a bunch of semantically  meaningless div tags, but rather a nice semantic document, whose intrinsic structure is enough to go on, in order to formulate a "transform" that doesn't feel like a hack.

There is a growing (ðŸŽ‰) list of semantically meaningful native-born DOM Elements which developers can and should utilize, including dialog, datalist, details/summary, popup/tabs (ðŸ¤ž) etc. which can certainly help reduce divitis.

But even more dramatically, with the advent of imported, naturalized custom elements, the ratio between semantically meaningful tag names and divs/spans in the template markup will tend to grow much higher, looking more like XML of yore. trans-render's usefulness grows as a result of the increasingly semantic nature of the template markup.  Why? Because often the markup semantics provide enough clues on how to fill in the needed "potholes," like textContent and property setting, without the need for custom markup, like binding attributes.  But trans-render is completely extensible, so it can certainly accommodate custom binding attributes by using additional, optional helper libraries.

This can leave the template markup quite pristine, but it does mean that the separation between the template and the binding instructions will tend to require looking in two places, rather than one.  And if the template document structure changes, separate adjustments may be needed to keep the binding rules in sync.  Much like how separate css style rules often need adjusting when the document structure changes.

## The core libraries

This package contains three core libraries.  

The first, lib/TR.js, is a tiny, 'non-committal' library that simply allows us to map css matches to user-defined functions, and a little more. 

The second, lib/DTR.js, extends TR.js but provides robust declarative syntax support.  With the help of [custom] enhancements we rarely if ever need to define user-defined functions, and can accomplish full, turing complete (?) rendering support while sticking to 100% declarative JSON.

In addition, this package contains a fairly primitive library for defining custom elements, froop/CE.js, which can be combined with lib/DTR.js via lib/mixins/TemplMgmt.js.

The package [xtal-element](https://github.com/bahrus/xtal-element) builds on this package, and the documentation on defining custom elements, with trans-rendering in mind, is documented there [WIP].

So the rest of this document will focus on the trans-rendering aspect, leaving the documentation for xtal-element to fill in the missing details regarding how froop/CE.js works.

## value-add by trans-rendering (TR.js)

The first value-add proposition lib/TR.js provides, is it can reduce the amount of imperative *.selectQueryAll().forEach's needed in our code.  However, by itself, TR.js is not a complete solution, if you are looking for a robust declarative solution.  That will come with the ability to extend TR.js, which DTR.js does, and which is discussed later.

The CSS matching that the core TR.js supports simply does multi-matching for all (custom) DOM elements within the scope, and also scoped sub transforms.

Note that TR.js is a class, with key method signatures allow for alternative syntax / extensions.

### Selecting/Matching

Although the way we match elements is almost identical to standard CSS, trans-render provides support for syntax that is more convenient for JS development.  Syntax like this isn't very pleasant:

```JavaScript
"[part~='my-special-section']": {
    ...
}
```

... especially when considering how common such queries will be.

In addition, one of the goals of the DTR is that the transform can be embedded as JSON-in-HTML, which becomes annoying when there need to be quotes in the string (have to use &apos).

So transform.js supports special syntax for css matching that is more convenient for JS developers:

```JavaScript
mySpecialSectionParts: {
    ...
}
```

Throughout this documentation, we will be referring to the string before the colon as the "LHS" (left-hand-side) expression.

### Syntax Example

    <summary>Example 1</summary>

```html
<body>
    <template id=Main>
        <button data-count=10>Click</button>
        <div class="count-wide otherClass"></div>
        <vitamin-d></vitamin-d>
        <div part="triple-decker j-k-l"></div>
        <div id="jan8"></div>
        <div -text-content></div>
    </template>
    <div id=container></div>
    <script type="module">
        import { TR } from '../../lib/TR.js';
        TR.transform(Main, {
            match: {
                dataCountAttrib: ({target, val}) =>{
                    target.addEventListener('click', e => {
                        const newCount = parseInt(e.target.dataset.count) + 1;
                        e.target.dataset.count = newCount;
                        transform(container, {
                            match: {
                                countWideClasses: ({target}) => {
                                    target.textContent = newCount;
                                },
                                vitaminDElements: ({target}) => {
                                    target.textContent = 2 * newCount;
                                },
                                tripleDeckerParts: ({target}) => {
                                    target.textContent = 3 * newCount;
                                },
                                idAttribs: ({target}) => {
                                    target.textContent = 4 * newCount;
                                },
                                textContentProp: 5 * newCount,
                                '*': ({target, idx}) => {
                                    target.setAttribute('data-idx', idx);
                                }
                            }
                        });
                    })

                }
            }
        }, container);
    </script>
</body>
```

</details>

The keyword "match" indicates that within that block are CSS Matches.

TR supports two other such keywords:

| keyword   | purpose                                                   |  notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| match     | bind to dynamic properties of the host                    |  Uses css match on Elements
| make      | attach element enhancements, set static properties        |  Uses third party enhancements that can add functionality or help with the template binding
| evaluate  | use xpath to finding book-ended processing instructions   |  TODO

So for example, this:

```JavaScript
dataCountAttribs: ({target, val}) => {
    ...
}
```

is short-hand for:

```JavaScript
fragment.querySelectorAll('[data-count]').forEach(target => {
    const val = target.getAttribute('data-count');
    ...
})
```

What we also see in this example, is that the transform function can be used for two scenarios:

1.  Instantiating a template into a target container in the live DOM tree:

```JavaScript
tr.transform(Main, {...}, container)
```

2.  Updating an existing DOM tree:

```JavaScript
tr.transform(container, {...})
```

We can also start getting a sense of how transforms can be tied to custom element events.  Although the example above is hardly declarative, as we create more rules that allow us to update the DOM, and link events to transforms, we will achieve something approaching a declarative yet Turing complete(?) solution.

The following table lists how the LHS is translated into CSS multi-match queries:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Pattern</th><th>Example</th><th>Query that is used</th><th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

## Extending TR, DTR "vertically"

The lib/DTR.js file extends the class in the file lib/TR.js, and continues to break things down into multiple methods, again allowing for alternative syntax / implementations via method overriding.

Most all these methods are asynchronous, so they can dynamically load modules.  Following this pattern, the implementations in those methods impose no penalty unless they are actually used.

We will discuss this type of extension later.

## Extending TR, DTR "horizontally"

### Verbal "spells" via inline decorators / element behaviors

The [be-enhanced](https://github.com/bahrus/be-enhanced) library provides the base class for element behaviors / decorators that can be used to enhance server-side generated HTML.

For example:


```html
<span></span>
<button be-counted='{
    "transform": {
        "span": "value"
    }
}'>Count</button>
```

Note that within the options spelled out in the be-counted attribute, we see the DTR syntax this package provides -- indicating in a concise, declarative way that the value of the count should be applied to the textContent property of the span element.  (We haven't yet described the DTR syntax - it is explained below.  Consider this a teaser.)

But more generally, from a 30,000 foot above the ground vantage point, the element decorators/behaviors add dynamic behavior to the button element (in this case), similar to how a custom element adds dynamic behavior to an unrecognized tag.  In no way are be-decorated element behaviors expected or required to use trans-render syntax.  Some do, many don't.

Viewed from that vantage point, custom-attribute based element decorators/behaviors are a way of intermingling inline binding right in the HTML itself, which hydrates as the JS dependencies download.  We are using these decorators to "cast spells" on the HTML markup -- "Be Counted!" in this example. 

With SSR / SSG this is often the best we can do -- let the browser do what it does best, render HTML, then, as soon as possible, enhance the HTML with dynamic behavior as defined by the element decorators/behaviors.  But it comes at some cost, which might not be ideal for components that repeat all through the page.  Progressively enhancing HTML isn't optimal when working with templates, which are optimized for repeated HTML, which is the specialty of web components.  So inline element behavior/decorators would be somewhat limited in usefulness, if we can't apply the same logic to the Web Component / repeating HTML scenario.    

What follows, then, is a way we can have our cake and eat it too.  We provide two fundamental ways we can carry over this way of casting spells, but instead of doing so inline, now we do so by adhering to the spirit of the trans-render approach -- casting the spells from a distance, during template instantiation.

A nice analogy might be the Harry Potter series (for example), where the students first learn to cast spells verbally.  As they become more advanced, they learn that there are advantages to being able to cast the spells quietly.  So we will use that analogy in what follows -- casting "non verbal spells".  These non verbal spells don't add any inline attributes.

### Non-verbal spells via "make" transforms

#### Synchronous, render blocking

In the following example, the "spell" that we perform on the button element is done "non-verbally" -- it is "spelled out" in the transform itself, leaving the HTML markup pristine:

```html
<template id=templ>
    <span></span>
    <button>Count</button>
</template>
<div id=target></div>

<script type=module>
    import 'be-counted/be-counted.js';
    import {DTR} from 'trans-render/lib/DTR.js';
    DTR.transform(templ, {
        host: {},
        make: {
            button: {
                be: 'counted',
                having: {
                    transform:{
                        span: 'value'
                    }
                    
                }
            }
        }
    }, target);
</script>
```

So essentially the "verbal" attribute got removed from the button element, and has moved over into the settings of the transform, which quietly applies the identical logic, without the need for attributes being added on the button element.

Doing the spell non verbally, i.e. during template instantiation, has the advantage that any adjustments we make to the DOM will be less expensive, as the browser won't need to make progressive re-renders as the decorators take effect.

The disadvantage is we block rendering until all the components are loaded.

###  Asynchronous, non-render blocking

However, if we don't want to wait for all the decorator components to download before rendering to the live DOM tree, we can import the decorators *asynchronously*, using dynamic import(), and then, depending on the timing, the "spell" that is cast on the button element may be done during template instantiation, or after getting applied to the live DOM tree.  

We can do this by simply taking advantage of the dynamic import function:

```html
<template id=templ>
    <span></span>
    <button>Count</button>
</template>
<div id=target></div>

<script type=module>
    import('be-counted/be-counted.js');
    ...
</script>
```

### Other options with make

We can also use the make key to specify static properties to assign into the element, using 'beAssigned'.

We can also specify static properties to deep merge into the element, using "beMerged".

We can specify to wait for the custom enhancement to "resolve" before proceeding.  This does impose render blocking.

We can finesse that further by specifying to wait for the custom element to resolve, only if the initial enhancement is already loaded in memory (which means any dependencies that might be dynamically loaded are sure not to be far behind, either in the download queue, or already in cache.)

## Match vs Make

So now we have no less than two ways of "binding from a distance" -- via the transform/match expressions, and via the transform/make expressions.

One significant difference between them is that the transform/match expressions are capable of being re-applied as the host model / property values change.  

The transform/make expressions provide no such support.  However, the decorators themselves can choose to hook up with the host and essentially accomplish the same thing, but that is internal to each decorator.  From the point of view of this package, those decorators are black boxes, so no assistance with binding is provided.

(At the risk of overwhelming the dear reader with if's, and's and but's, the trans-render package does support something called ["dynamic transforms"](https://github.com/bahrus/xtal-element#part-iii-dynamic-transforms), allowing even the make transforms to pass in dynamic data, but that is a more advanced topic, so we are getting way ahead of ourselves).

The rest of this document will primarily focus on the "Match" expressions.

## Declarative trans-render syntax via JSON-serializable RHS expressions with lib/DTR.js 

The examples so far have relied heavily on arrow functions.  (In the case of plugins, we are, behind the scenes, amending the matches to include additional, hidden arrow functions on the RHS.)

As we've seen, this provides support for 100% no-holds-barred non-declarative code:

```TypeScript
const matches = { //TODO: check that this works
    details:{
        summary: ({target}: RenderContext<HTMLSummaryElement>) => {
            ///knock yourself out
            target.appendChild(document.body);
        }
    }
}
```

These arrow functions can return a value.  DTR.js has some built-in standard  "post match" processors that allow us to "act" based on the data either returned by a function like above, or much more likely, already in JSON-serializable format (i.e. no function, making the transform totally JSON serializable). 

The capabilities of these post-match processors are quite limited in what they can do, due to the small number of expression types JavaScript (and especially JSON) supports.

So we reserve the limited declarative syntax JSON provides for the most common use cases.

The first common use case is setting the href, or the value, or the textContent of an element, which we lead up to below.

## Declarative, dynamic content based on presence of ctx.host

The inspiration for TR came from wanting a syntax for binding templates to a model provided by a hosting custom element.

The RenderContext object "ctx" supports a special placeholder for providing the hosting custom element:  ctx.host.  But the name "host" can be interpreted a bit loosely.  Really, it could be treated as the provider of the model that we want the template to bind to. 

But having standardized on a place where the dynamic data we need can be derived from, we can start adding declarative string interpolation:

```JavaScript
    match:{
        "summary": ["hello",  "place"],
        "a": ["hello",  "place"],
        "input": ["hello",  "place"]
    }
```


... means "set the textContent of the summary element to "hello [the value of the "place" property of the host element or object]".  In the case of an anchor element, the href will be set.  And in the case of the input, the value will be set.



Let's look at an example in more detail:

```html
<details id=details>
    <summary>Amor Omnia Vincit</summary>
    <article></article>
    ...
</details>

<script type="module">
    import { DTR } from 'trans-render/lib/DTR.js';
    DTR.transform(details, {
        match:{
            "summary": ["Hello", "place", ".  What a beautiful world you are."],
            "article": "mainContent"
        },
        host:{
            place: 'Mars',
            mainContent: "Mars is a red planet."
        },
    });
</script>
```

The array alternates between static content, and dynamic properties coming from the host.

The binding support for string properties isn't limited to a single property key.

If the property key starts with a ".", then the property key supports a dot-delimited path to a property.  And "??" is supported.  So:

```JavaScript
match:{
    summary: ["Hello ", ".place.location ?? world"],  
}
```

will bind to host.place.location.  If that is undefined, then the "world" default will be used.  If the string to the right of ?? starts with a ., the same process is repeated recursively.

Like most all UI libraries, only changes to top-level properties of the host are reacted to automatically.

## Extending trans-render virtually

There's yet a third dimension to how we can extend trans-rendering - via "virtual tags/attributes".

### Virtual Tags from a distance -- Invoking a method from the host via "Virtual Tags" in RHS expressions [WIP]

If the RHS is a string that can be html parsed as a single tag, and if the host has a method that matches the tag after stripping attributes and children, then that method can be invoked:

```TypeScript
import {RenderContext} from 'trans-render/lib/types';
const html = String.raw;
class MyClass extends HTMLElement{
    [`<my-custom-processor/>`](ctx: RenderContext, parsed: Document, args: Map<string, any>){
        //knock yourself out
        const {target, parsedRHS} = ctx;
        target.appendChild(document.body);

    }
}


...
match: {
    countPart: html `<my-custom-processor dtr='{
        "host": "options",
        "match": {

        }
    }'/>`
}
```

What this does:

1.  If method found, calls that method, passing in the render context and the parsed html
2.  If method not found, searches for template element with id specified by tag name, and instantiates it

Note that we can even "override" built in element names like table, ul, etc.

## Loop Mixin [TODO]

The trans-render package provides a mixin class, trans-render/lib/mixins/Joins.js, that has some methods specifically for joining "virtual" tags together, also know as for-each / loop / repeat, etc:  Final name subject to change.

```TypeScript
const html = String.raw;
match: {
    'div#menu-quick-options': html`
        <inner-join each option, index of host.options;>
            <menu-option 
                pass key, icon, label, url in option;
                pass index;
                pass type in host;
            /> 
        </inner-join>
    `
}
```

words "each", "pass", and "in" are optional.  They are there for readability.

If we need to rename values:

```TypeScript
const html = String.raw;
match: {
    'div#menu-quick-options': html`
        <inner-join 
            each option, index of host.options;
        >
            <menu-option 
                pass myKey=key, myIcon=icon, myLabel=label, myURL=url in option;
                pass idx=index;
                pass myType=type in host;
            /> 
        </inner-join>
    `
}
```

To hardcode values:

```TypeScript
const html = String.raw;
match: {
    'div#menu-quick-options': html`
        <inner-join with option, index of host.options>
            <menu-option 
                myKey=hello icon="https:..." label=someLabelHardcodedVal url="https://..." idx-n=7 type=22
            /> 
        </inner-join>
    `
}
```




inner-join means treat the calling div element -- in this case: \<div id=menu-quick-options></div>)' -- treat its inner content as fully determined by the list of menu-options specified within, i.e. no support for skirting around content that may have already been inside the div element, before or after.

Other methods:

join-after -- carefully append content after the calling element -- typically the caller will be an empty template element, and we need adjacent content to be compatible with finicky native-HTML, like table or list elements.

### Inline Virtual Tags - Global Auto Method matching: [TODO]

A trans-render option, "autoMatchMethods" does the following:

1.  The host object which the transform is being bound to is scanned for methods matching one of these two patterns:



```JavaScript
class MyClass extends HTMLElement{
    async [`<my-custom-processor/>`](ctx: RenderContext, parsed: Element, args: Map<string, any>): Promise<TBD>{}

    async ['[my-custom-attribute]'](ctx: RenderContext, parsed: Element, args: Map<string, any>): Promise<TBD>{}
}
```

Any such methods will cause trans-render to always be on the look-out for elements matching (in this case): 'my-custom-processor' and '[my-custom-attribute]', respectively.  When encountered, the rendering context is passed in (and awaited) before proceeding.

The method can return a TBD object structure, which TR can use, for example to decide whether some DocumentFragment should fully replace the target tag, or be carefully appended adjacently.

## Invoking (a chain of) methods

Limited invoking of methods is supported.

For example:

```JavaScript
match:{
    countPart: '.count.toLocaleString|'
}
```

means "evaluate toLocaleString() of the count property."  

The pipe operator allows one hardcoded string argument:

```JavaScript
match:{
    countPart: '.count.toLocaleString|en-US.indexOf|,000'
}
```

In many circumstances, the transform is kept separate from the HTML template, so we can still import HTML templates, even from untrusted third-party providers.  The syntax to invoke the method is not in the template, but rather in the separate transform.

## P[E[A[T]]] 

After setting the string value of a node, setting properties, attaching event handlers, and setting attributes (including classes and parts), and specifying the light children comes next in things we do over and over again

So we reserve another of our extremely limited RHS types JSON supports to this use case.

We do that via using an Array for the rhs of a match expression.  We interpret that array as a tuple to represent these settings.  P stands for Properties, E for events, A for attributes, T for a template the clone into the light children. 

### Property setting (P)

We follow a similar approach for setting properties as we did with the SplitText plug-in.  

The first element of the RHS array is devoted to property setting:

```html
<template id=template>
<my-custom-element></my-custom-element>
</template>

<script type=module>
    import { DTR } from 'trans-render/lib/DTR.js';
    DTR.transform(template, {
        match:{
            myCustomElementElements: [{
                myProp0: ["Some Hardcoded String"], 
                myProp1: "hostPropName", 
                myProp2: ["Some interpolated ", "hostPropNameForText",
                ".mySubProp1.mySubProp2": "otherProp",
            ]}]
        },
    });
</script>
```

The same limited support for . and ?? described above is supported here.

### All About E

The second optional element of the array allows us to add event listeners to the element.  For example:

```JS
match:{
    myButtonEs: [{}, 'myClickHandler'],
    myCustomElements: [{}, {click: myEventHandlerFn, mouseover: 'myHostMouseOverFn', 'myProp:onSet': {...}}]
    
}
```

As we can see, TR/DTR supports fours ways to hookup an event handler.  

If the second element of the array is a string, then the host method 'myClickHandler' is called.  On what event type, you may be asking?

If the matching element is an input element, then event type "input" is used.  Otherwise, "click" is used.  So that's our big-time shortcut.

For more nuanced scenarios, we need to specify an object for the second element of the array.  Let's look closely at the three examples shown above for the 'myCustomElementEs' matches:

The first one (myEventHandlerFn) is not JSON serializable, so it doesn't qualify as "declarative".  It works best with arrow function properties of the host (no binding attempt is made).  

To be declarative, use the name of the public method of the host, as demonstrated by the second example.  Again, no binding attempt is made (revisit?  Could cause memory leaks according to Lit team).

In the third example, we can see that the RHS of the expression can be an object.  We'll call it the "action object".  This action object provides a declarative syntax for doing common things done in an event handler, but declaratively.  Things like toggling property values, incrementing counters, etc.

The syntax for what can go inside this action object is borrowed from the [be-noticed](https://github.com/bahrus/be-noticed) decorator, and much of the code is shared between these two usages.

The properties of the action object can be broken down into two categories:

1.  Selecting which element and property to modify.
2.  Specifying how to modify the element/property. 

#### Selecting which element modify:

<table>
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Action Object Property</th>
        <th>Meaning</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td><i>Unspecified</i></td>
        <td>Select the host of the triggering element.</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>toUpShadow</td>
        <td>Id of Dom Element.  Uses import-like syntax:
            ./my-id searches for #my-id within ShadowDOM realm of  instance.
            ../my-id searches for #my-id one ShadowDOM level up.
            /my-id searches from outside any ShadowDOM.
        </td>
        <td>Searching for a DOM element outside the ShadowDOM realm to which the triggering element belongs seems like it could produce some complex tight coupling, and should probably be used sparingly.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>to</td>
        <td>Abbrev of toUpShadow</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>toSelf</td>
        <td>Perform action onto itself (the triggering element)</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>toNearestUpMatch</td>
        <td>Perform action on the nearest previous sibling / ancestor element matching this css pattern, using .previousElement(s)/.parentElement.matches method.</td>
        <td>
            Does not pass outside ShadowDOM realm.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>toClosest</td>
        <td>Use the closest method to search for the element based on the value of this property.</td>
        <td>&nbsp;<td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>tocoho<td>
        <td>To closest or host -- search for containing element with attri bute "itemscope", or the host for the shadowDOM boundary, which ever is closest</td>
        <td>&nbsp;<td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Specify the action on the element being modified

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Action Object Property</th>
            <th>Meaning</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>prop</td>
            <td>Modify this property name of the element being modified</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>fn</td>
            <td>Name of method or property arrow function to invoke on element being modified</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
Action:

plusEq, toggleProp, fn, prop, dispatch, eqConst

Note also in the third example, with LHS: "myProp:onSet", we are not subscribing to a loosely coupled event name, but rather, we are injecting a handler inside the myProp setter, which is a bit intrusive, but is quite powerful, and doesn't require emitting events for everything.

### Set attributes / classes / parts / [decorator attributes](https://github.com/bahrus/be-decorated). (A)

Example:

```JS
match:{
    myCustomElementElements: [{}, {}, {
        myAttr: "myHostProp1", 
        ".my-class": true, 
        myBoolAttr": true, 
        myGoAwayAttr: null, 
        "::my-part": true, 
        beAllYouCanBe: {
            some: "JSON",
            object: true,
        }}]
}
```

### Set Light Children (T)

The fourth optional element can either be a template, or an HTML string that DTR converts into a template.  It is cloned, transformed based on the inherited transform rules, and appended to the element, after deleting the previous content.

## Boolean RHS -- Remove and Refs

If the RHS is boolean value "false", then the matching elements are removed.

If the RHS is boolean value "true", then the matching elements are placed in the Host element with property key equal to the LHS. This is the "ref" equivalent of other templating libraries.  One difference, perhaps, is the property is set to an array of weak references.


[TODO] Show examples

## Ditto notation

One limitation JS / JSON has, that css doesn't have, is we can't use the same key twice.

To overcome that, we can have multiple rules with the same key, if the subsequent keys start with a ^ character.

For an example of this, [see below](#example-3----switch).

## Conditional RHS

### Prelude

Much conditional display logic can be accomplished via css -- set various attributes to string values as described above, pulling in values from the host, then allow css to interpret those attributes in such a way as to accomplish the conditional display we are after.

But sometimes this isn't sufficient.  Sometimes the values of the attributes (or properties) themselves need to be conditional.  

One approach to accomplishing this is by adding a "computed property" to the host element that calculates what the value of the attribute should be, with the full power of JavaScript at our disposal.  But this solution may not be sufficient when we *have* no host class to begin with (e.g. declarative custom elements).  And it may also be argued that even if we do, these types of computed properties are too tied to the UI.

So, that is what the declarative expressions below address.  As with everything else in this library, the logic for this is only loaded on demand, so use or don't use, the penalty is minimal either way.

### On to business

If the RHS is an array, but the head element of the array is a boolean, then we switch into "conditional display" logic.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>First Element Value</th>
        <th>Second Element Usage</th>
        <th>Third Element Usage</th>
        <th>Fourth Element Usage</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>true -- strict mode</td>
        <td>The second element is expected to be an object that matches the <a href="https://github.com/bahrus/be-switched/blob/baseline/types.d.ts#L5" target=_blank>BeSwitchedVirtualProps type</a>.  Only the right hand side of many of those field expressions are evaluated recursively from the rules above.
        </td>
        <td>
            If the second element is satisfied, apply the third element according to all the rules above (recursively), assigning values / attaching event handlers on the target element.
        </td>
        <td>
            If the second element is **not** satisfied, apply the fourth element according to all the rules above (recursively), assigning values / attaching event handlers on the target element.
        </td>
        <td>
            Syntactically, it looks a bit odd to interpret "true" as "you are now looking at a conditional statement".  
            If editing the transform in js/mjs, it might seem more intuitive reading if using this "true || false".
       </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>false -- loose mode</td>
        <td>JavaScript expression that is evaluated against the Shadow Realm</td>
        <td>"</td>
        <td>"</td>
        <td>Big time TODO</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Example 1 - Boolean expression

```html
<template id='templ'>
    <input>
</template>
<div id='target'></div>
<script type='module'>
    import {DTR} from '../lib/DTR.js';
    const conditional = true || false; // call it whatever makes it more readable
    const dtr = DTR.transform(templ, {
        host: {typeIsBoolean: false},
        match:{
            input: [conditional, 
                {
                    if: 'typeIsBoolean', //condition
                },
                [{type:['checkbox']}], // if condition is true
                [{type: ['range']}] // if condition is false
            ]
        }
    }, target);
</script>
```

results in:

```html
<div id='target'>
    <input type=range>
</div>
```

So as we can see, the conditional expression incorporates the P[E[A[T]]] logic mentioned above, as far as setting the type attribute.

Remember that within PEAT expressions, to specify a hardcoded string, as opposed to a path coming from the host, strings need to be wrapped inside an array (to allow for interpolation).

### Example 2 -- Comparison

```html
<template id='templ'>
    <input>
</template>
<div id='target'></div>
<script type='module'>
        import {DTR} from '../lib/DTR.js';
        const iff = true || false;
        const dtr = DTR.transform(templ, {
            host: {type: 'boolean'},
            match:{
                input: [iff, {lhs: 'type', op: '===', rhsVal: 'boolean'},[{type:['checkbox']}]]
            }
        }, target);
    </script>
```

So "lhs"/"rhs" keys are expecting a path to evaluate from the host.

"lhsVal"/"rhsVal" keys allow us to hardcode a value.

The example above results in:

```html
<div id=target>
    <input type=checkbox>
</div>
```

Note that op: '===' is optional, and is currently the only operator supported. More will be added [TODO].

But even though it is optional, spelling it out may make the syntax more readable.


### Example 3 -- Switch

```html
<template id='templ'>
    <input>
</template>
<div id='target'></div>
<script type='module'>
    import {DTR} from '../lib/DTR.js';
    const iff = true || false;
    const dtr = DTR.transform(templ, {
        host: {type: 'boolean'},
        match:{
            input: [iff, {lhs: 'type', op: '===', rhsVal: 'number'}, [{type:['range']}]],
            '^': [iff, {lhs: 'type', op: '===', rhsVal: 'string'}, [{type:['text']}]],
            '^^': [iff, {lhs: 'type', op: '===', rhsVal: 'boolean'}, [{type:['checkbox']}]],
        }
    }, target);
</script>
```

results in:

```html
<div id=target>
    <input type=checkbox>
</div>
```

## Loop RHS [TODO, maybe]

If the lhs resolved to a template element, and the rhs is an array, and the first element of the array is also an array, then we are now specifying a rudimentary loop.

I'm not being modest when I say "rudimentary".  It can only repeat multiple instances of a single tag.

The second element provides the tag name to repeat.

```html
<menu-option -index -label type-e=type icon-e=options{index}.icon></menu-option>
```

```JavaScript
match: {
    menuOptionE: [["options"]]
}
```

becomes:

<template>
    <template name=definitive>
        <menu-option -index-n -label-s type-e=type icon-e=options{index}.icon></menu-option>
    </template>
    <template name=expanded>
        <menu-option index=7 label=hello></menu-option>
        <menu-option index=11 label=goodbye></menu-option>
    </template>
</template>

Since this is not (yet?) supported, use an element decorator (via "non verbal spells") such as [be-repeated](https://github.com/bahrus/be-repeated).

### DTR/TR method extensions for RHS =  Non Array Object

Recall how we can extend TR/DTR "vertically" by overriding the built-in methods with subclasses.

There's one RHS type we have conspicuously avoided discussing so far -- where the RHS expression is a non-array object.  

Here is where we really enable making the TR/DTR classes extensible "vertically".

If the RHS is a non-array object, the determinant for what to do with such expressions is based on the reserved field with reserved key "$action".

Method with name do_object_[$action] is invoked.  A single parameter of the render context is passed in.

### Nested Matching

Just as CSS will support nesting (hopefully, eventually), TR supports nesting out-of-the-box.  

If the RHS is a non-array object, and that object has field $action:"nested_transform", then the nested transform is performed (via calling do_object_nested_transform) as discussed above.

### Deep Merging [TODO]

Normally, the "P" expressions, where we set prop values, is done via "shallow merge" - Object.assign type expressions.

An exception to this rule is that if prop keys start with a ".", then we can actually do some deep binding, which is quite useful:

```JavaScript
transform: {
':host': [{
    ".style.width": ['', 'width', 'px'], ".style.height": ['', 'height', 'px']
}],
```
But sometimes the desire is to do a deep merge of a fairly large object -- a style object is a perfect example, and don't need live "binding" because the merge is done as part of a "dynamic transform" -- where the transform itself contains dynamic values.

To meet this scenario, if an object has $action:'deep_merge' then it will be deep merged into the host.

## Setting Props the easy way

If the RHS expression is a non array object without an $action property, then the RHS is used to set properties on the element.

## Answers to questions no one is asking

<details>
<summary>API details</summary>

>Does TR/DTR cache anything?

TR caches the results of querySelector* in weak references, for rapid updates.  

>How do I clear the cache?

ctx.self.flushCache()

>When should I clear the cache?

Any transforms that alter the DOM, like lazy loading or conditional display.

>Should I share instances of TR/DTR across multiple hosts?

No.  The caching is tied to the host.
