## Binding from a distance

*trans-rendering* (TR) provides a methodical way of "binding from a distance" -- updating DOM fragments without the need for custom inline binding instructions.  It originally drew inspiration from the (least) popular features of XSLT, and more significantly, CSS.  Like those syntaxes, TR performs transforms on elements by matching tests on those elements.  TR uses css tests on elements via the element.matches() and element.querySelectorAll() methods.  Unlike XSLT/CSS, though, the transform is defined with JavaScript, adhering to JSON-like declarative constraints as much as possible.

TR rests on:

1.  A JavaScript object -- the model.
2.  A DOM fragment to update / enhance.
3.  A user defined "Fragment Manifest" where the binding rules are defined, mostly declaratively.
3.  Optionally, an EventTarget that emits events when properties of the model change.

TR is designed to provide an alternative to the proposed [Template Instantiation proposal](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Template-Instantiation.md), the idea being that TR could continue to supplement what that proposal includes if/when template instantiation support lands in browsers.

## Use cases for TR

1.  Hydrating / adjusting server-rendered content.
2.  Hydrating / adjusting (third party) HTML retrieved via fetch.
3.  Hydrating / adjusting (third party) HTML output from an XSLT transform.
4.  Combined with progressive element enhancement (custom attribute) libraries, such as [be-enhanced](https://github.com/bahrus/be-enhanced), that can also be attached "from a distance", we can build custom elements that can easily evolve over time with absolutely no framework lock-in.

XSLT can take pure XML with no formatting instructions as its input.  Generally speaking, the XML that XSLT acts on isn't a bunch of semantically  meaningless div tags, but rather a nice semantic document, whose intrinsic structure is enough to go on, in order to formulate a "transform" that doesn't feel like a hack.

There is a growing (ðŸŽ‰) list of semantically meaningful native-born DOM Elements which developers can and should utilize, including dialog, datalist, details/summary, popup/tabs (ðŸ¤ž) etc. which can certainly help reduce divitis.

But even more dramatically, with the advent of imported, naturalized custom elements, the ratio between semantically meaningful tag names and divs/spans in the template markup will tend to grow much higher, looking more like XML of yore. trans-render's usefulness grows as a result of the increasingly semantic nature of the template markup.  

In addition, the introduction of the aria- attributes for accessibility, "part" attributes for styling, as well as the re-emergence of microdata attributes as a standard that here to stay, means that we using a library like TR nudges us to "do the right thing" and adopt semantic approaches to our HTML, resulting in elegant approaches to binding.

This can leave the template markup quite pristine, but it does mean that the separation between the template and the binding instructions will tend to require looking in two places, rather than one.  And if the template document structure changes, separate adjustments may be needed to keep the binding rules in sync.  Much like how separate css style rules often need adjusting when the document structure changes.
